    <p>Russia says that the U.K was, in some capacity, 
      responsible for the Nord Stream pipeline getting blown up. 
      My first guess was the Polish, tbh. Why
      would any European state blow the pipeline? Germany's committment 
      must've begun to waiver, and blowing the pipeline was a way of saying 
      "you don't have a choice but to stay the course". Scary stuff if you think about it.</p>
    
    <p2>The protests across Europe get next to no coverage. Seems like every week I get wind of a new one, 
      but virtually no coverage in Western media.
    </p2>
    
    <p>The U.S bitching about human rights and war crimes
      while having put up the most numbers is beyond parody. 
      War, and all the suffering that arises from it, is 
      and always will be indefensible. But really...
      the U.S leading the charge? That's the equivalent
      of the C.I.A saying "torture is bad". </p>
    
    <p>Anyone who is surprised about the West's support for 
      fascist / terrorist proxiesis just showing that they 
      haven't studied history. My favorite example is Gladio, the operation 
      in which the West, but principally the U.S. and U.K. trained and armed 
      fascists to disrupt the rise of a Post-WWII European left. And don't even get me 
      started on 80s Afghanistan and the Taliban.
    </p>
    
    <p>The Hunter Biden article that detailed his corruption and the 
      coordinated efforts of the State and Big Tech to kill that 
      story before the election was one of the boldest acts of
      partisianship I can think of. Dozens of C.I.A agents declared
      the story *Russian Disinformation* and then Twitter and Facebook
      blocked their users from sharing and linking it. Not one of those
      people faced consequences. Not one of those people was forced to
      apologize. And they never will. A government agency, taking it 
      upon itself to leverage it's prestige to suppress information
      that could impact how people vote. Is this not election interference?
      It was, but because they're the "good guys", it's ok. 
    </p>
    
    <p>The lamest political stunt that's been taking off as of recent
      is to crash these fundraisers and campaign speeches and shout about
      how those politicians are funding terrorism and pushing the world closer to 
      a larger, more disastrous conflict. While the protestors are correct,
      do you think it's gonna change anything? George Bush Jr gave an 
      interview somewhere and talked about the dangerous of misinformation
      like he didn't invade a country on a lie and kill a million people.
      Logic cannot beat someone who's illogical. With logic, you operate
      within the bounds of reason and objectivity. Those without logic, do not.
      The protestors also assume that telling the truth will change anything.
      The impenetrable defense of those types is decorum. If you're loud, you're 
      breaking decorum. If you're angry, you're breaking decorum. If you're agitated,
      you're breaking decorum. Watch any of those videos. The people who shut down the 
      protestors aren't usually security or staffers, but people in the crowd who take
      it upon themselves to restore order. It's quite funny actually.
    </p>
    
    <p>The people who funded jihadi terrorists are the same one's calling foreign 
      adversaries state-sponsors of terrorism. Remember the "moderate rebels" in Syria
      who engaged in ritualistic cannibalism? Or the "freedom fighters" in Libya who 
      established a open-air slave markets selling African migrants? It's almost like everyone
      is sponsoring terrorists to fight their battles or something.
    </p>
    
    <p>The State Department calling for freedom of speech and freedom of press while actively
      persecuting whistleblowers and blacklisting journalists who don't recite the right 
      lines is also very funny.</p>
    
    <p>The gullibilty of people is wild. The Democrats have been promising to codify Roe v. Wade
      for almost a decade. Maybe even longer. But they never will. If they codify it into law, 
      then they can't run on that platform anymore, can no longer dangle the carrot in front of the rabbit. 
      Same as the border. Neither party wants to actually solve the border issues because then 
      they can longer use it as a platform to run on or use to criticize their adversaries.
    </p>
    
    <p>All it took was a change in the Presidential adminstration to change the narrative regarding the border issue.
      In 2016-2020, the Trump policies (cruel and barbaric) were, to democrats, indistinguishable from that
      of Nazism. These policies were defended or ignored by Republicans. When Biden got into office, and these policies 
      remained largely the same, in some aspects worsed by the opening of more detainment facilities, Democrats ran defense
      of the policy and Republicans made those same vapid trips to those facilities in protest, the same one's they 
      defended just years prior. It's all so tiresome. Nobody care's about this people, but instead
      of solving the issue, they just lock them in cages and use them malign their political enemies. It's 
      so dehumanizing. 
    </p>
    
     <p>Anyone surprised by the defence mainstream media is running for the FTX ghouls clearly hasn't learned this undeniable fact:
       People in power don't suffer consequences. There were no consequences for the engineers of '08 financial crash,
       no consequences for the troves of leaked financial documents about offshore bank accounts by the world elite, and I highly doubt there
       will be any for FTX. 
    </p>
    
     <p>The Haitian struggle is one that will be won. The West has been conspiring to keep Haiti down since Haitian slaves
       liberated themselves. The West wants Haiti to remain a malleable island that they can exploit for it's labor. 
       For reference, look into the human rights abuses against haitian workers by American companies. Start with 'Levi's'
       and the threads will unravel themselves
    </p>
    
     <p>I literally remember where I was when the fake story about 'Russia paying the Taliban to kill American soldiers' dropped.
       It was everywhere for weeks and then, years later, they quietly admitted it was a lie. A false story, planted by the State, was amplified 
       by every major news network in the U.S. By the same news networks that actively employ former spies and feds from the various alphabet agencies.
     </p>
    
    <p>Justin Trudeau used his power to crush COVID protestors, lock their bank accounts and destroy their lives then have
    the audacity to voice vocal support for the protestors in China. Liberals spent years maligning anyone who disagreed
    with the harsh, and frequently draconian nature of the COVID response as far-right and called for them to be barred
    from society. Those same liberals are singing the praises of the Chinese protestors. Either all protests are bad or they're 
    all justified. Trudeau specifically, without a shred of shame, gave his vocal support to the Chinese after using the Wartime measures
  	to crush his own citizens. He's just mad Xi Jingping suplexed him for the world to see</p>
    
    <p>Love him or hate him, watching Xi Jingping bitch slap Trudeau for his snide attempt to belittle China behind their
      back was so goddamned funny. </p>
    
    <p>The governments and media outlets that, for years, maligned Julian Assange and spread outright fabrications about him have
    now started to call for the charges to be dropped. They don't want the charges to be dropped. Nor do they care. This all just 
    a ploy so that when Assanage is locked away for the rest of his, which I firmly believe he will be, they can try to say they
    were on the right side of history.</p>
    
    <p>I have noticed over time that America, or rather the West, has a peculiar relationship with black people of wealth, power and status. There is nothing
      liberals hate more than a black man who doesn't tow their line, who doesn't echo their opinion. An uncontrollable Black celebrity
      is dangerous but an that uncontrolled force can reach and influence people who they need to win elections and implement their agendas and legislation.
      It was perhaps two years ago when a politicians named Tim Cotton, a black republican, made a dissenting statement following one of Biden's national addresses. Cotton basically
      said that he disagreed that America was a racist country. As a result, many took to Twitter and initiated a hashtag called 'Uncle Tim', a play on the 
      'Uncle Tom' trope. Disturbingly enough, a lot of those people gleefully tearing him down were white liberals. Let that sit for a moment. White liberals telling 
      a black man he's a black person because he disagrees with them. White liberals telling a black man he's a race traitor for disagreeing with them. White 
      liberals saying, you are a bad black person for not following the script. And I disagree with Tim Cotton, but I can do that without invoking a trope. 
      </p>
    
    <p>When NBA players floated the idea of strike cause of the George Floyd stuff (don't get me started on the riots), guess who stepped in
      and stopped that shit immediately? Barack Obama. Why? Because an NBA strike was not a part of the plan, nor could they allow it to be 
      successful. If players organized en masse in response to major social, economic, or geo-political events, that would severely undermine 
      the ease with which the State can fuck things up. The Boondocks had an episode called "The Return of the King", an alternate history episode
      where MLK survives being shot. The episode concludes with MLK telling black people to do better and the effects, such as the NBA players organizing
      a total league strike until there is a full troop withdrawl from Iraq. That kind of power was, at one point, within the realm of possibility.
      And that scared them.
    </p>
    
   <p>The Twitter files being released hasn't really impressed me. We know they do this stuff, this type of censorship and state collusion. Seeing the behind the scenes way in which 
     they conspire to do so is more interesting that anything. Regardless, I hope this leads to reckoning.
